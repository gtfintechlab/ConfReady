# Process File Documentation

**File:** `process_file.ipynb`

**Encoding:** `utf-8`

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook, `process_file.ipynb`, was automatically generated by Google Colab. The original file is accessible at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sP7HcCtkLrSBRESeL5dcLK06sJvfBMt6).

## Objectives

The notebook aims to address the following points:

1. **Metadata Filters:**
    - Implementation pending for metadata filters.
    - Reference: [GitHub Issue #9334](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/issues/9334).
    - Goal: Filter for citations or footnotes for specific questions.
    - Consideration: Using Chroma for inclusion.

2. **Response Format:**
    - Introduced a cleaner response format, primarily JSON.
    - Each response includes justification.

3. **Specific Adjustments:**
    - **A3:** Currently outputs "yes" and section. Needs to be revised to output only "yes" or "no" with justification.
    - **D2:** Should incorporate information on crowdsourcing.
    - **D4:** Should indicate whether approval was given or if it was exempt.

4. **Node Post Processing:**
    - Not yet implemented: reranking or keyword-specific inclusion/exclusion.
    - Potential improvements for prompts B1 and B3.
    - Previous implementations exist, and reintegration is feasible.

5. **Figure Captions:**
    - Currently, more than just captions are included.
    - Need to restrict output to captions only.

## Learning Resources

- **Book:** "Learning from this book: [RAG Ebook](https://mallahyari.github.io/rag-ebook/intro.html)".
- **Priyanshu's Work:** Contributions and methodologies from Priyanshu's projects and research.

## Notes

- Ensure all responses are justified and formatted in JSON.
- Implement and test metadata filters to enhance query-specific accuracy.
- Revise output formats for prompts A3, D2, and D4 for clarity and precision.
- Explore and integrate node post-processing techniques for improved prompt handling.
- Refine figure caption extraction to include captions only.
