## Instructions

### Application Structure
- Put all the configurations files and the JSON files in the `sysconfig` folder. If your part of the application has a lot of these files, create a subfolder under `sysconfig`.
- All assets such as images, PDF and Latex examples, put them under the the `assets`. For data files like PDF and Latex files, create another folder. 
- Rename the frontend code to `app` and move all the stable files such as images, .`ico` and .`txt` files into a separate sub-folder under  `assets`.
### Clean Code
- Remove Jupyter Notebook Files. 
- Try to reduce to code as much as possible. Lesser the code, better the application and the easier it is to maintain.
